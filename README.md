This is answer for coding challenge for USAA

## How to run code.

run git clone https://github.com/ARasheed14/usaacodingchallenge.git

npm install

## Functionality not finished.

I added favorite button on detail view page. The favorite button adds the food report to a favorites array in the local storage, but I didn't add the functionality to pull the favorites into the component.

## Didn't refactor structure of providers
For time I used the Ionic Generator and didn't get to refactor my services into the proper functionality directory.
