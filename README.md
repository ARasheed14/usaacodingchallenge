This is answer for coding challenge for USAA

## How to run code.

run git clone https://github.com/ARasheed14/usaacodingchallenge.git

npm install

## Functionality not finished.

I added favorite button on detail view page. The favorite button adds the food report to a favorites array in the local storage, but I didn't add the functionality to pull the favorites into the component.

## Didn't refactor structure of providers
For time I used the Ionic Generator and didn't get to refactor my services into the proper functionality directory.


## LocalStorage from Ionic class
I used Ionic's storage module. which uses WebSQL by default. I could have configured for localstorage but ran out of time.

## Found two non feature related bugs
When I ran the code later after the challenge I notieced two small bugs that were not feature related. One letter that caused an error and a configuration item that caused an error.
